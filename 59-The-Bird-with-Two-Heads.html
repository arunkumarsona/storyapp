the bird with two heads

There once lived a bird with two heads. While one head faced to the right side, the other faced to the right side. One day, when the bird was flying over a river, the left head spotted a bright red fruit on a tree adn immediately flew to it to eat it. As it was eating it, the right head asked, "May I also taste the fruit?" To this, the left head replied, "We have the same body and it doesn't matter who eats it". To this, the right head replied that it wanted to taste the fruit. The left head argued back saying that it found the fruit first. 
The next day, while flying over a river, the right head saw a fruit and this time, it flew towards it to eat it. The other birds on the tree warned it not to eat it as it contained poison. But the bird did not listen and ended up eating it. Just a few minutes later, the right head, left head and the entire body of the bird dropped to the ground, dead.
