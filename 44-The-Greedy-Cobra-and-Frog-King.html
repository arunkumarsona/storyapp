The greedy cobra and king of frogs

There once lived a frog in a well. He was the king of frogs but none of his relatives respected him. One day, he stepped out of the well and met a cobra. He went to the cobra and said, "Dear cobra, I would like to be your friend". The cobra replied, "I am your enemy! Why would you want to be my friend? I can eat you up". The frog then replied that he knew a well where he could find many frogs to eat. The cobra was happy and agreed. However, the frog told him that he must only eat up his relatives and not his friends. the cobra agreed to this as well. Before going, the snake asked, "How do I enter and leave the well? I cannot climb the slippery walls". The frog then told him about a secret entrance to the well. He went through that and ate up all the relatives of the frog.
One day, the cobra was very hungry. He sneaked into the well and ate up a friend of the frog. This continued again for many days and finally, only the king of frogs was left. To save his life, he said, "I know another place where you'll find amny frogs. Remain in this well and I shall bring those frogs to you". The cobra believed him and entered the well through the special entrance. As soon as it did so, the frog locked the door from outside and ran away, saving its life.

Moral: Never trust your enemies.
