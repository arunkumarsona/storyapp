There was once a lake which had a banyan tree beside it. Many cranes had found shelter in that tree. In the hollow of the saem tree, there lived a snake which was poisonous. Each time a crane was born, the poisonous snake killed it and ate it up. 
One fine day, the same tragedy happened to a mother crane as well. It's young one had been eaten up by the snake. It stood weeping near the lake. A crab noticed the crane crying and decided to ask what the matter was. The mother crane narrated what had happened. After this, the crab thought for a while. It decided to make a plan to kill the snake as well as the cranes as the cranes were its enimies. 
"I have a pla. There lives a mangoose nearby. Go to its burrow and sprinkle a few pieces of fish and flesh and make sure you sprinkle it till the residence of the snake. That way, the mangoose will follow the food triats and eventually kill the snake as well", the crab said. The crane found it a good idea and did so. Everything happened as per the plan and the snake was killed by the mangoose. However, since the magoose had reached the tree where the cranes also lived, it climbed up the tree and killed the crane as well!

Moral: Do not get into trouble while solving a problem.
