The bird and the monkey

On a mountain top, there lived a few monkeys. On a rainy day, it poured heavily in the place where the monkeys resided. They were all drenched and cold. They shivered in the cold and wanted a source of heat. While they looked for heat, one of the monkeys saw a bunch of fruits lying which seemed to be glowing with bright colour. The monkey mistook it to be embers. It informed the other monkeys about it and all of them picked up those fruits and started blowing them, with a hope to light fire with it. 

A bird which was sitting on a tree, happened to witness the scene. The bird knew that they were fruits after all and not embers. To help the poor monkeys, the bird called out to them and said, "Those are fruits and not embers as you consider them to be. You will not be able to light fire out of them. Drop them back. You can instead find some shelter for yourself to protect yourself from the cold". 

The monkeys were annoyed by the bird's advice and replied, "You cannot fool us. Do not interfere in your work". The bird, not willing to leave the monkeys continue their fruitless task, flew down from the tree and approached them. It started advising the monkeys again. Furious by the disturbance caused by the bird, one of the monkeys hit the bird hard against the ground. The bid was badly wounded.

Moral: To not advice anyone if they do not ask you for it.
