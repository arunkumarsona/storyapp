There onced lived a brahmin in a town. He was a thief and all of them believed that he had a perfomed sins in his previous life due to which he was a thief. 
One fine day, a few other brahmins arrived to this town for thier business. They had a very successful business and meanwhile, the theif kept track of all this. He made plans to steal all the money from them. Hence, he approached them and instantly became their friend. They were impressed by his immense knowledge in the holy scriptures. He then asked them if he could work along with them and they agreed. 
One fine day, after selling all their wares, they earned a lot of money. However, they felt that it would not be safe to carry such a huge amount of money with them. For this, they thought of a solution and exchnaged their money for jewels. To hide these jewels, they cut open their thighs and hid it inside them. They soon recovered them with a special ointment which they possesed. Now, the thief knew that they would head back to their hometown. He hadn't got an opportunity yet to steal their wealth. Hnece, he decided to go along with them to their hometown as well. 
As soon as they were to leave, the thief started to weep. "What happened, brother? Why are you crying?" one of the brahmins asked. 
"It has been so wonderful working with you all and now it hurts to leave you all. May I please come along with you all?" he asked. The brahmins felt sorry for him and instantly agreed to take him along. 
All of them started their journey soon. As they were heading, they had to go through a jungle. In that jungle, there lived a tribe whose chief had a magical crow. As the brahmins and the thief entered the jungl, the magical crow told its master that they had a lot of wealth hidden in them. Immediately, the chief came up to them and stopped them. They searched their belongings and their clothes but were in vain. 
"I am sure you have wealth hidden in you as our magical crow never lies to us. We can even cut open your bodies and find the treasure", they said. The thief thouht for a while. Along with killing the brahmins, they would kill him too as they would not believe him if he said that he did not have anything with him. Hence he told the chief, "Dear chief of the tribes! Do not kill all of us to find treasure. Instead, kill me. If you find anything, it is all yours". The chief instantly agreed and killed him but did not find anything. He then apologised to the rest of the brahmins and let them free.
