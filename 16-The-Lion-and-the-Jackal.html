The lion and the jackal


Vajradaunstra was a lion who lived in a jungle. He had two attendants for himself- a jackal and a wolf. 

One fine day, the three of them saw a caravan passing by the jungle. There was a carrying camel in the caravan too. The camel was to deliver and hence, she could not proceed further. Hence, the caravan moved forward, allowing her to stay back. As soon the caravan moved forward, all three of them pounced on her and began to eat her. They tore open her womb and found a baby camel in it. Being full and satisfied with the meal, they decided to spare the baby camel. The lion decided to take the baby camel along witht them. 

The lion told the camel that it shall live along with them fromt then on. He also assured the camel that he is free to wander around without free as everyone shall be informed that he is under the protection of the lion. All four of them lived together, often telling each other stories and having a jolly time together. The camel went along with lion almost everywhere. 

One day, the lion had got into a terrible fight with an elephant. He had managed to return home with great effort. Since he was starving, he ordered the three of them to bring him an animal for his meal. All three of them went in search of an animal but were in vain. They returned home, without being able to find a meal for everyone. 

Just then, a sly thought struck the jackal- the camel did not belong to them and if it was killed, it would easily form a meal for many days. The jackal thought of a plan to convince the lion to kill him as he had promised to protect the camel. 

The jackal then went up to the camel and said, "We do not have any food and we were unable to find some either. Our master and the rest of us shall starve to death. When all of us die, some other animal shall attack you and you shall be its prey. Thus, it would do good if you offer yourself to the lion. If you do so, God shall bless you with another life where you shall be born, twice the size as you are now". The innocent camel readily agreed for the sacrifice, realising that if the lion had not protected him till now, he would have been dead by now. 

The jackel came up to the lion and said and told him that if he worships God and kills the camel for a meal, he shall be born twice the size in his next life and to that, the camel had also agreed. The lion too believed the jackel and agreed to do so. The jackal immediately killed the camel. 

The lion asked the wolf and jackel to guard the carcass as he would return after a bath and worship of the Gods. The jackal then thought of a plan to have the entire camel for himself. He went up to the hungry wolf and said, "You may have a bit of the flesh as you are hungry. I will be on your side and convince the lion later on". The wolf fell for his words and started to eat the flesh. The jackel asked him to stop eating as soon as he saw the lion approaching. 

The lion arrived and saw that a portion of the flesh was eaten. He shouted in anger, demanding to know who had eaten it, inspite of the two guarding it. The jackal cunningly said to the wolf, "You ate the flesh although I warned you not to. Shame on you!" The lion angrily attacked the wolf and the wolf fled for its life. 

Just then, a caravan was approaching at a distance. Since the camels had bells tied around the neck, the noise was heard by the lion. Curiously, he asked what the noise was. The jackel replied, "It must be the God of death, Yama approaching you for killing the camel. The ancestors of camel are also arriving to take revenge on you. Do run away, master!" The lion believed his cunning words and ran away. After he was gone, the camel enjoyed all the flesh for himself for many days. 

Moral: Stay away from the cunning, else shall put you in grief.
