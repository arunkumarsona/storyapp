The crows and the cobra

There once lived two crows on top of a banyan tree. Near the same tree, there lived a wicked cobra. Each time the crow laid eggs, the cobra would steal it. Dissappointed by this, they approached a jackal to resolve the issue. The jackal gave them an idea and the crows acted accordingly. One of the crows went to a palace nearby and stole a precious necklace that belonged to the princess. The gaurds saw the crow carry away the necklace and ran behind it. The crow then dropped it into the hole where the cobra lived. The gaurds dug the hole and killed the cobra to retain the necklace. Thus, the crows peacefully lived wihtout the cobra.
