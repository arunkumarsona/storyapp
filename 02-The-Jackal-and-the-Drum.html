The Jackal and the drum

Long ago in a Jungle, there lived a Jackel. He was very hungry and was desperately in search of food. When he was searching for food, he lost track of his way and entered into a deserted battlefield. It was the end of the battle; therefore the warriors have already left. There was a tree nearby, and they all were hiding behind a drum placed below the tree. Strange noise was produced because the leaves and branches of trees rubbed against the drum.

The jackal got scared due to the noise and was about to run away. He thought that someone was making the noise and they will hurt him for trespassing. But he got a second thought and went bravely to look who was making the noise. Because the jackal thought that, "It was not wise to run away without understanding the real circumstances". So he went carefully and found out the reason for the noise. 

The jackal was surprised to see that no one was making the noise and it was just the tree rubbing against the drum. He was much more astonished to see that there was also food available near the drum.
Then the jackal ate all the food and went back to his jungle happily.

Moral of the story: Only the brave men tend to succeed in life.
