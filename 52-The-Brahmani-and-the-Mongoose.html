The brahmini and the mangoose

There once lived a brahmin and his wife. They had recently given birth to a baby boy. On the same day, a mangoose near their house had given birth too but sadly, the mother mangoose died immediately. The couple decided to adopt it. The mangoose and the couple's baby grew up together. One day, when the brahmini was away for work, the mangoose took care of the baby. Suddenly, snake entered into their house. In order to protect the baby, the magoose attacked the snake and killed it. By this, his paws were covered with blood. As soon as the wife returned, she saw the blood on the mangoose's hands and immediately assumed that it has harmed her son. She angrily threw a pot on the mangoose, leaving it severly wounded. She ran to her baby, only to find it safe. She then saw the dead snake and realised her mistake
