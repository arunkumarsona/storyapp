Fighting billy goats and the Jackal

One day, a sage was walking though the hills, where he saw two billy goats ramming on each other. Those goats were severely wounded and the blood was oozing all over the place. The jackal that smelled the blood in the floor started licking the blood. 

The sage advised the jackal not to be greedy and lick the blood as it may get hurt, when the goats fight with one other. But it did not listen to the sage and was licking the blood in the floor. Eventually, it went neat the fighting goats and got wounded severely and fell on the ground.

Then the jackal realized that if he hadnâ€™t been greedy, then he would not have been hurt.

Moral of the story: Greediness leads to disaster.
