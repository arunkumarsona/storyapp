Tale of golden droppings

There once lived a bird named Sindhuka. This was not an ordinary bird but a very special one. Each time its droppings fell on to the ground, it turned into gold.
One day, a huntr was passing by the jungle in search of birds. Even after a long time, he couldn't find any. He decided to take some rest adn sat under a tree. It so happened that it was the same tree where Sindhuka resided. When he was resting, the birds droppings fell to the ground and turned into gold. THe hunter was shocked by what he had seen. He then thought, "If I capture this bird and keep it for myself, I will soon become very rich". He then slowly put a net around the tree and caught the bird. The bird suddenly realised that it was trapped and regretted not noticing the net at all. As he was heading home, he thought, "If I become rich all of a sudden, the nieghbours will become suspicious. If they get to know the truth, they shall inform the king about this. Instead, I'll only go and give this to the king and he shall greatly reward me for it". He did so and presented the bird in front of the king and told him about his speciality. The king was veyr surprised by it. Just then, one of his ministers said, "Oh, King! How on Earth can a bird give droppings that can be converted into gold? This man is lying and he must be punished for it". The king too agreed and ordered for the bird to be set free. Just as it was set free, it dropped a dropping and it turned into gold. The king was shocked to see that. He immediately asked his gaurds to catch the bird but this time, the bird was careful enough and flew away.

Moral:What seems to be impossible must also be checked twice.
