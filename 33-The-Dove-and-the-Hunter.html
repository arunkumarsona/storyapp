The dove and the hunter

There once lived a hunter who was known to be very cruel. He mercilessly killed all animals and birds in the jungle. One day, he came to a jungle where a couple of doves. The couple was a very happy one and always lived together. However, when the hunter came to the jungle, he caught hold of the female dove when she was alone. He trapped her in a cage and took her along. Suddenly, it started raining very heavily and a storm came up too. The hunter ran for shelter and found a tree. Since there was a hole in it, he decided to spend the night there, waiting for the rain to stop. This, happened to be the same tree where the doves resided. On top of the tree, where the nest of the birds was placed, the male dove started to worry for his wife. 
"Where has she been? It is so late in the night and she still hasn't returned. Is she is harmed by the rain or storm?" the male dove said, to himself. The female dove, upon hearing this, replied back, "I am inside the hole of the same tree where we reside. I have been trapped and caged by a hunter. However, it is not right for us to illtreat him as he is our guest. Please do offer him some shelter, warmth and food". The male dove was touched by her kindness. He flew down to the hole and said, "Dear hunter, welcome to this tree. Please do make yourself comfortable.
"Thank you, dove. I am very cold by this rain and storm. Thank you for offering me shelter",the hunter said. The dove then lit some fire for the hunter to make himself warm.
"I am sorry I do not have any food to offer to you. Hence I shall iffer you myself", said the dove and immediately jumped into the fire. The hunter, upon witnessing this sacrificing, felt guilty for all his deeds. "I have sinned in my life. I have taken away the life of many animals and birds by my hunting. I therefore, pledge to be a sage from now on", said the hunter and let the female dove free. 
"I do not see life beyond or without my husband. I do not have a reason to live", the dove said and jumped into the burning fire too. They both met in heaven for their good deeds. 
The hunter then transformed into a sage. One day, he spotted a fire buring in the jungle. He immediately felt it is right for him to pay for his sins this way and jumped into the fire. He was then offered a place in heaven for his realisation and sacrifice.

Moral: The biggest sacrifice you can do is self sacrifice.
