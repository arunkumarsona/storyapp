Right mind and wrong mind

There once lived two friends named Dharmabuddhi and Papabuddhi. Darmabuddhi, as his name suggests, was a very virtious man. On the othr hand, Papabuddhi, according to his name was wicked minded. 
One fine day, Papabuddhi decided to earn money. He knew that with his lack of skills and knowledge, he would not be able to earn any money. Hence, he decided to trick Dharmabuddhi by making him earn all the money and snatching it for himself in the end. He went up to him and said, "Dharmabuddhi, I feel it is ideal to satrt earning money for a living. Shall we go to the nearby kingdom and find ourselves a job?" Dharmabuddhi agreed to this. They both left for the kingdom on an auspicious day. 
They managed to earn a lot of money by Dharmabuddhi's skills. One fine day, they decided to return back home. 
On their way back home, Papabuddhi said, "It is wrong for us to carry so much of wealth with us. Our neighbourers might ask us for a share and we also stand chances of a theft. Hence, I suggested that we carry only a small amount which is enough for our needs and burry the rest near this tree". Dharmabuddhi agreed to this, not knowing of his cunning plans. After returning home, a few days later, Papabuddhi went back to the spot where they had burried the money. He dug open the spot and took away all the money, covering the pit again. He went to Dharmabuddhi and lied, "The money that I had taken home that day has been spent for my family needs. Shall we go back and bring some more money?" Dharmabuddhi agreed to accompany him to the spot. 
After reaching, Papabuddhi dug it open and pretended to be shocked to see the pit empty. He instantly blamed Dharmabuddhi for it. "No one else knew that we had hidden the wealth here. It was you who stole it all! Give back the money to me", he said, shouting at him. 
"I haven't stolen the money! Do not blame me for this", said Dharmabuddhi, shocked by his accusation. Papabuddhi said that he shall approach the elders of the village to resolve the matter. They did so and the elders said that they shall resolve the matter but first, they had to pledge to the God of Fire in order to find the real truth. 
To this, Papabuddhi said, "We shall pledge as told but before that, I suggest that we take this huge tree as the witness as it was here that we had hidden the money. The tree might reveal the truth about the truth to us". The wise people agreed to it and said that if the tree did not provide them with an answer, they would approach the Fire God.
Papabuddhi immediately went home and told his father about all this. His father too, with a greed for money, agreed to help him retain the money for themselves. As per the plan, his father sat inside the hold of the tree and planned to serve as a secret witness.
The next day, they all arrived at the tree to seek justice. They all asked, "Oh powerful tree, please provide us with justice for this quarel". Papabuddhi's father who was seated inside the tree said, "Dharmabuddhi is the thief and has stolen all the money". All of them were shocked to hear this. They asked the tree again and recieved the same reply. Dharmabuddhi, however became suspicious. He came up with an idea and decided to light fire near the hole of the tree. As soon as he did so, Papabuddhi's father came running out of it. Papabuddhi's dirty mind and intentions were finally revealed in front of everyone.

Moral: False truths are never hidden. They shall be revealed someday or the other.
