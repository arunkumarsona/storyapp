The story of the merchant's son

There was once a merchant named Sagardatta who had a son. One day, his son went to a store and bought a book which costed a lot. Upon returning home, his dad saw the book and was shocked that the entire book contained only one saying, "You get what is destined for you". He was outraged by this. "You are of no good! You have wasted money by buying such an expensive book which has nothing more than a sentence in it", he said, shouting at his son. Assuming that he will be no good at business either, he sent him out of the house. Disappointed by this, the young man left home. He kept chanting the sentence, "You get what you are destined for". 
After walking for a long while, he reached a village. One of the members of the village approached him and asked him his name. He repeated the same sentence, "You get what is destined for you". Hence, he was known by that name. 
One fine day, a princess had come by to attend a festival of the town. There, she spotted a handsome, young prince. She instantly fell for him. She called for one of her servants and handed over a letter that was to be given to him. The servant agreed to do so but gave it to the merchant's son ny mistake. He read the letter which said, "I have fallen in love with you and wish to meet you in my room. Come to the castle where you shall find a rope that leads to my room". THe merchant's son, assuming the letter to be for him, was overjoyed. He did as the letter said and reached her room. It was dark in there and the princess too assumed that it was the prince after all. SHe served him good food and drinks. She then said, "I have decided to get married to you. Do you agree to marry me as well?" To this, the young man replied, "You get what is destined for you". The princess upon hearing those words, immediately turned on the lights. As soon as she did so, she got to know that he wasn't the handsome prince she was waiting for. "How dare you enter my room! Leave immediately", she said, enraged. The man was disheartened and left the castle. 
He walked for a while and reached a temple. He decided to spend the night there and fell asleep. The watchman of the temple, not wanting him stay there, directed him to his house. 
The man reached his house but went to his daughter's room instead, by mistake. The daughter happened to be waiting for her lover and assuming him to be her man, in the dark, she put a garland over his neck, thus getting married to him. The man again said, "You get what is destined for you". She immediately realised that he was the wrong man. She got angry and threw him out of the house. 
He began to walk again and saw a marriage procession on the way. Suddenly, the elephant which was a part of the procession, started running wildly towards the bride. Since she was too shocked and scared, she did not know what to do. Just then, the young man ran to her and saved her life. Mesmerized by his kindness, she expressed her wish to marry him and only him. By this, there was a huge arguement among the relatives. The matter was then taken to the king of the town. Everybody arrived there and the princess and the watchman's daughter too happened to arrive. The king asked the young man about the incident. His only reply was, "You get what is destined for you". Noticing the embarrasment of the watchman's daughter and the princess, the king demanded to know what had happened. All the three ladies fought to get married to him. 
A while later, the king decided to resolve the matter. He got the princess and the other two ladies too, married to the young man and everything turned out to be right. 

Moral: Be right on your part. Leave the rest to destiny.
