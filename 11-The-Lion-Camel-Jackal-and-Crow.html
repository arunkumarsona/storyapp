The Story about the Lion, the Camel and the Wicked Jackal

In a jungle, there lived a lion with his friends namely a crow, a leopard and a jackal. They were friends for a long time and they have been together for a while. One day, they saw a camel feeding on the grasses. The King was not aware what the animal was, so it ordered the jackal to bring the camel to the lion. But the crow knew it was a camel since it has travelled various places. The crow told that the camel has a lot of flesh and would make a delicious meal. But the King refused to hunt it down and said that the camel was a guest to their jungle.

So when meeting the camel, King lion told to the camel that it could stay in the jungle and can eat grass all the time. The lion promised protection to the camel. After a few months, the king got injured and became so weak that it could not hunt anymore. The crow, leopard and jackal were dependent on the lion for food, so all the four animals grew weak that they couldn’t walk properly.

The jackal told the lion that, "You have grown so weak that you cannot hunt. We depend on you for food, and we have become weak too. So to survive, we need food to come to us." The animal’s effort was in vain as they could not find any prey. So the jackal informed the lion to kill the camel. But the King lion refused to do so as he had promised the safety of the camel. The jackal plotted and said that, "You need not hunt him down, If he accepts to give his life, Will you feed on him?" The lion agreed. 

The following day, the animals assembled in front of the lion. The jackal declared that, "Our King has become weak, so he needs food to survive. We have to give good food to maintain his health."

Then the crow offered himself to be his food to show its loyalty. Then the jackal said that I have much more flesh and I would be the perfect fit for curing my King’s hunger. On hearing this, the camel said that," I am a herbivores, and I feed on grass. So kindly feed on me, my King".

As soon as the camel accepted, the lion attacked the camel and fed on it. The other animals also feed on the camel and satisfied their hunger.

Moral of the story: Do not get offended by the sweet words, and then you will be fooled.
