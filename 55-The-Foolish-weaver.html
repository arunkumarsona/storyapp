The foolish weaver

There once lived a weaver along with his wife. Everyday, he would go to the jungle to bring wood. One day, as usual, he went to the jungle and began to chop a tree. Suddenly, a genie appeared and said, "Do not chop this tree. In return I'll grant you anything that you want". The weaver immediately went home and told this to his wife. HIs wife told him to ask the genie for an extra head to think more and two more hands to work more. Without thinking twice, the foolish weaver returned back and asked the genie for it. He was gifted with it and when he was returning home, the villagers thought that he was a monster and beat him up!
