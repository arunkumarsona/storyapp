Story about the Bird Pair and the Sea

There lived a pair of Tittibha birds near the sea shore. The female bird was about to lay eggs, so it told its husband to find a safe place to lay eggs as the sea waves might swallow all the eggs. But the male bird was so negligent that it said, "Nothing can harm the eggs. So don’t worry and lay the eggs."
The female bird insisted about the dangers but the male bird did not listen to its wife. It said that, "The sea wouldn’t dare to swallow the eggs." The female bird laid the eggs and went in search of prey. The sea shore on hearing this thought that the male bird was so disrespectful. To teach them a lesson, the waves got higher and swallowed the eggs. 

When the birds returned, they were shocked to see the eggs missing. The female bird started to cry and blamed the male bird for its irresponsibility. The male bird got angry over the sea and decided to take revenge. It told that, "I am going to dry the entire sea and will retrieve our eggs. I will do it by sucking the water with my strong beak."

The female bird knew that it was impossible and foolish. But the male bird wouldn’t listen. The female bird suggested getting the help of other birds to seek revenge for taking away their eggs. The other birds knew that the male bird’s idea was foolish. So they suggested that they seek revenge by asking Garuda, the God of Birds. 
The Garuda understood the disastrous happenings and went straight to Lord Vishnu and said that, "O My Lord, As we all know sea is your resting place. But that place has caused me  trouble by taking away the eggs of the innocent Tittibha birds. I have not got any revenge due to the gratitude that I have towards you."

Lord Vishnu considered his request and said, "Garuda! I will warn the sea and will return the eggs to those innocent birds."

Lord Vishnu took his thunder bolt and warned the sea that, "Sea! You have been cruel. You will face my anger if you don’t return the eggs to Tittibha birds."

The sea got scared and apologized for its behavior. Then the sea gave back the eggs.

Moral of the story: Do not underestimate the power of the innocent people.
