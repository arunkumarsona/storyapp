The tale of two snakes

There was once a king who was named Devashakthi. He had a son who was very weak and unhealthy. No matter how much he ate, he wouldn't gain any weight. The king called the greatest of doctors to cure him but they told the king that there was a snake inside his body due to which he would never be cured. The king got tired of trying and became very depressed by his son's poor health. The son too could not see his father grieve anymore. Hence, he decided to leave home. One day, he left home and started walking to where destiny would take him. He reached another kingdom. He found a temple there and decided to live there. He ate the alms that he got everyday and lived his life. 
In the same kingdom, there lived a king who had two daughters. The king loved his daughters a lot. Every morning, they both would seek the blessings of their dad. One daughter always thanked him for everything while the other daughter kept saying, "We get the fruits of our own actions". This did not make the king happy. Day by day, he grew angrier and fine day, he oredered his ministers to send her out of the palace and get her married to whomever they first see. They did accordingly. The first person they spotted was the Devashakthi's son who lived in the temple. They got the princess married to him. She too accepted him as her husband, happily. They both decided to move to another town, in search of a place to live. As the prince was very weak, he sat down under a tree to take rest. The princess went to get him some food to eat. As she returned, she saw a snake next to the tree he was sitting under. Just as she was about to wake him up, she saw another snake come out of his mouth. She stood at a distance and quietly watched. 
The snake in the hole siad, "Why do you live inside his stomach? If drinks the soup of cumin seeds and mustard, you shall die immediately". To this, the snake inside him replied, "Why do you gaurd those two pots of gold? If someone pours hot water and oil on you, you shall die too". After the arguement, both the snaked returned back to their places. The clevr princess brought a bowl full of cumin seeds and mustard soup and gave it to her husband. He drank it and as expected, the snake died. She then poured hot water and oil into the hole and the other snake died too. While her husband recovered completely, both of them found two pots of gold and they lived happiy ever after.
