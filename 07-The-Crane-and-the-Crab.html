The story about the Crane and the Cunning Crab

Once upon a time, there lived a crane near the lake along with the fishes and other creatures. He was living there for a really long time that he had grown old and weak. He could not make his meal because he had become feeble.
So he made a plan to make a meal for himself every day at ease.

There was a crab living by the lake that was very intelligent. The crane started his plot by crying in front of the crab.

The crab on seeing the crane crying asked him, "What happen to you uncle? Why are you crying?" The crane replied that, "I have become weak and old and could not make my meal anymore. So I decided to fast myself to death". The crab questioned the crane that, "Uncle, why are you crying then? You had decided this with your whole heart. Then why are you feeling sad?"

The crane replied that, "I spoke to an astrologer; he told me that it wouldn’t rain for the next 12 years. So that this lake will become dry and all the creatures in this lake will die".

The crab was shocked and threatened to hear this. The crab asked the crane whether he was sure about the news.	

The crane replied that, "Yes, my son. I am telling you the truth". The crab intimated this horrific news to everyone in the lake. The other creatures and fishes got so scared. So they went to the crane for advice. Everyone asked the crane to give an idea to protect them.

Then the crane said that there was a lake nearby which is full of lotuses and it would not get dried up at all. The crane also promised that it would help each fish to reach there one by one every day. Everyone agreed to the crane’s idea as they believed that the crane was fasting to death.

The following day, the crane told that he would take a fish to the nearby lake. But on the way, the crane killed the fish by dropping it on the rock and ate it. He continued the same plot for a few days. The crane told the other fishes in the lake that the dead fishes were happy and flourished. 

One day, the crab got suspicious and requested the crane to take him to the other lake. The crane was excited that he could eat crab today. On the way to the other lake, the crab found out that what the crane was doing by seeing the bones of the fishes in the rock.

The crane said victoriously that it was a plot to have his meal and came to eat the crab. But the crab grabbed the crane by its neck and killed it. Then the crab told the truth to the other fishes in the lake that the crane’s words were a plot.

Moral of the story: Any tough situation can be handled through wit.
