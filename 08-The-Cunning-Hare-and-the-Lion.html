Story about the Cunning Hare and the Lion

In a jungle, there lived a lion. He was considered to be the king of the jungle. He killed many animals everyday unnecessarily. So all the animals went to the lion and made out a deal that every day one animal would be sent out to the lion to feed his hunger. So there won’t be a necessity to kill the animals. The lion also accepted this deal. But the lion warned that if someone who does not adhere to this deal, all the animals would be killed the lion.

So every day, one animal is sent to the lion to feed his hunger based on their luck. One day, a hare was chosen to feed the lion. The hare was not willing to go to the lion’s den, so it went slowly. On the way, it saw a well and made a plot to kill the lion. It went very slowly to the lion’s den. The lion was very much hungry and got angry on seeing such a small animal to feed him. The lion shouted at the hare for coming late and told that he was going to kill all the animals in the jungle for making him wait. 

The hare pleaded the lion to listen to the reason for why the hare was late. The lion told the hare to make it fast. Then the hare told that, "Master! We were sent as a group of 5 hare to feed you. Another lion was trying to attacked us on the way. We told him that we are going to feed our master. But it stated that it was the king of the jungle". Another lion also stated that," your master must prove his strength; otherwise I will be the King of the jungle". It took the other 4 hares as hostages and let me go to inform you this.

The lion got furious and told the hare to take it to that lion’s den. The hare warned that another lion was very powerful and ferocious. The hare informed the lion to go near the well. On seeing its own reflection, the lion thought that was its competitor. It attacked it and fell into the well and died.

Then the hare went happily to the jungle and told everyone about the incident. All the animals appreciated the hare and lived happily without fear.

Moral of the story: The wicked can be defeated through cunning mind only.
