Four friends and a hunter

There once lived four friends in a jungle. They were a deer, rat, turtle and a crow. They were always together and lived happily. 
One day, a hunter viisted the jungle. He suddenly caught hold of the deer in a trap. It struggled to set itself free but couldn't do so. It then made a plan and pretended to be dead. Immediately, the turtle came near the hunter to distract him. The hunter, assuming the deer to be dead, went behind the turtle. Immediately, the rat bit the net of the trap and set the deer free. The crew picked up the turtle and flew away. Hence, all the four friends were saved from the hunter.

Moral: Teamwork is most important
