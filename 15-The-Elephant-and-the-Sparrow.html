The Story about the Wicked Elephant and the Sparrow

A family of sparrows lived in the top of a tree in a forest. They built their beautiful nest with delicate care and immense hard work. They lived there with their new born eggs. A huge elephant was living in the same forest. One day, the elephant went insane due to the summer heat. He thrashed all the trees on the way and broke the branches which supported the sparrow family’s nest.  Therefore, the eggs fell on the ground and were smashed on the group.

The husband and wife sparrow escaped but they could not save their eggs. The sparrows started crying. There was a woodpecker in the forest. It was the sparrow’s friend. On hearing the cry of the sparrows, the woodpecker came and asked what the issue was. The sparrows told what had happened. 

The woodpecker said that the wicked elephant had killed its family. The woodpecker said that crying does not cure any problem; we have to accept the circumstances. The sparrows said that it is true but they have lost their children due to that wicked elephant.

The sparrows asked the woodpecker to help them to take revenge on the elephant which killed its eggs. The woodpecker agreed to help them. The woodpecker then asked a fly who was its friend to help him out. The fly also agreed to help in taking revenge over the cruel elephant. 

Then they went to the frog to ask him to help to destroy the cruel elephant. The frog also agreed to do. It said that, "The elephant is alone. But we are together. We can destroy him. I have made a plan".

Then he explained the plan that, "Fly! You must buzz in his ears when the sun is at its peak. It would feel thirsty. Then woodpecker! You must poke the elephant’s eye and should make it blind. So when it is searching for water by not being able to see, The frog must croak, so that the elephant would think that there is a pond nearby, then it will fall into the pit and it would learn a lesson."

The plan was executed accordingly. The elephant fell into the pit and got heavily wounded.

Moral of the story: When you are united, then no one can defeat you.
