The brahmin and the cobra

Once upon a time, there lived a brahmin. He was named Haridatta. He was a very hard working farmer. However, despite all these efforts, he never got good produce from his farm. One day, when he was working in the farm, he felt very tired by the burning heat adn decided to take rest under the shelter of a tree. He sat down for a while and then looked beside him to find an anthill. Out of that, a cobra suddenly emerged. The brahmin, following the tradition, went home and brought a plate of milk and offered it to the snake. 
"Please do forgive me. I did not know that you reside here. Please accept this milk and bless me", he said. The next day, he came to the anthill and found a gold coin in the plate which he had kept. He was very happy and took it home. The next day too, he offered milk to the snake and it gave a gold coin in return. This went on everyday until one day, the brahmin had to travel to another town for some work. To keep the tradition going, he informed his son to offer a plate of milk to the cobra everyday in his absence. 
The next day, the son did as his father had informed. He was surprised to receive a gold coin in return. He then thought, "There must be a lot of gold inside the anthill. If I kill the cobra, I can take away all the gold". He then brought a stick and hit the anthill to break it. The cobra immediately came out, angrily and bit the son. He died immediately by the poison. 
After the brahmin returned home, he got to know of the news of his son's death. The villagers informed him that they shall kill the cobra in turn for revenge. 
"Do not harm the cobra. It is not at fault", the brahmin said. He immediately went and offered it a plate of milk as usual. This time, the cobra came out and said, "Shame on you! Your son has died, yet you come here for greed. I do not want such a friend. You care not of your son and you also care not of the wound caused to me by your son's attack. Take this diamond and go away from here and never return". The cobra gave him a diamond and went back into its hole. The brahmin never returned there again.

Moral: Greed crosses all limits of humanity.
