Frogs that rode a snake 
There was once a snake who was very old. He grew even older day by day and could not hunt for his own food anymore. He decided to find a way out for this. 
He went to a nearby pond and sat still without harming any of the frogs present there. The frogs initially got scared by looking at the snake there and then realized that it is sitting very still. One of them went to the snake and asked, "Oh, snake! Why do you sit so still without hunting?" To this, the snake pretended and replied, "What do I tell you? Yesterday, I went in search of food but could not find any. In anger, I bit the son of a Brahmin. Hence, the Brahmin cursed me that I shall never be able to hunt for a frog again, instead, I must serve them". The frogs were surprised and they went to the king and told him about this. The king too, came out and asked the snake about it. The snake agreed and told them that he could even give them a ride. The king agreed to it and took a ride on the snake's back. When the snake did not harm anyone, everyone else hopped on as well. 
The next day, the frogs and the king too was ready for a ride but the snake pretended to be very ill. When the frogs asked him, it replied, "I am very weak and old. I need food to be healthy". Hence, the frogs decided to serve good food to the snake. 
Day by day, the snake started to become healthier. The snake continued to serve the frogs and the frogs continued to serve good food. One day, when the snake had gained good strength, it ate up all the frogs and the king as well! 
Moral: Beware of your enemies even if they are in disguise.
