Story about the Turtle that Fell Off the Stick

There lived a turtle that had two swans as its good friends; they would share their stories till sunset. They both become friends and play together. One day, the swans realized that the lake was drying up. So they advised the turtle to find another lake to live on.

The turtle agreed and told that, "My friends! You can fly to various places. So find me a lake where I can live on." He continued that, "Fetch a stick and you both can hold it. I will bite the stick with my mouth so that you can take me to the lake." The swans agreed to the plan.

The swans found a lake which was full of water and informed the turtle about it. The swans warned the turtle not to speak, as it may fall down if it opened its mouth. The turtle agreed and the swans carried him above to reach to the lake.

On their way, a group of people in the town saw this, and was discussing about the swans carrying a turtle. 

Many people saw the swams sarrying turle & they all were talking about this incident. The turtle unable to control itself opened its mouth and asked, "What are they discussing about?" and it fell down to the ground. The town people took it and made a meal out of him.

Moral of the story: You must listen to your well-wishers.
