There was once a lion who had a jackal. As the lion was growing older day by day, it became weaker. He asked the jackal to go get an animal. The jackal went in search and found a donkey nearby. It went to it and said, "Oh, donkey! I know a female doneky who wants to get married to you. Would you like to come along?" To this the foolish doneky arrived. The hungry lion pounced on it and tried to kill it but the donkey escaped. The jackal then said, "Why didn't you let the doneky come closer?" The lion apologised and asked the jackal bring back the donkey. He went in search again and found it. He said, "Oh, donkey! Why did you escape? The female donkey wnated to hug you but you ran away". The donkey belived him and came back again. This time, the lion was careful enough and killed the donkey when it came closer. Later, it went to take a bath and told the jackal to wait for him. As the jackal could not wait, it ate up the brain of the donkey. When the lion arived, it angrily asked, "Why did you eat? The brain of the donkey is missing". The jackal replied, "The donkey did not have a brain at all! That is why it came back". The lion and jackal then enjoyed their meal.
