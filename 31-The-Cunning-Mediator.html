The cunning mediator

There once lived two birds on a tree. One of them resided on the branch while the other had found shelter in a hole of the same tree. THey were very good friends and spent a lot of time with each other, talking and telling stories to each other. One day, the bird which lived in the hole, left for bringing some food. However, he did not return within his usual time. The other bird started to worry. THe moon came up and it was night time but the bird hadn't returned yet. The other bird thought, "Is my friend in danger? Has some hunter killed him or is in some kind of danger?" 
Even the next day, the bird did not return. The other bird kept waiting but days later too, he did not return at all. With no choice left, he left hopes. One day, a hare came by and saw that the hole in the tree was empty. Hence, he occupied it and started living there. The other bird knew that the hole belonged to his friend but since he did not seem to return, he let the hare occupy the place.
Many days later, the bird returned back to its place, after staying at a place with ample food. As soon as it go to know that the hare had occupied the hole, it began to quarel with it. "This is my home. I wan you to leave immediately", the bird said.
"This place was empty when I came and hence, I occupied it. Now, you cannot claim it is yours", replied the hare. The quarel went on until they decided to approach someone wise to resolve the issue. Meanwhile, a wild cat had overheard their convrsation. Taking a chance, he immediately ran to a distance and dressed up as holy sage. The bird and the hare, upon seeing the cat, assumed it to be a very wise one. However, the stood at a distance to talk. The bird said, "Dear holy cat, we have approached you to resolve an issue between us. Please decide who is right and you may kill the other one". To this, the cat replied, "I shall not harm an of you as I have left the life of violence. However, I cannot hear you from that distance. Fear not and come near me". 
Innocently, both the bird and the hare went near it. As soon as they did so, the wild cat pounced on both of them and killed them.
