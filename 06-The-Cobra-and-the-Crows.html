The wicked cobra and the crows

A family of crow was living in the tree where they built a beautiful nest. In the same tree, a wicked cobra also lived in the hollow of the tree. The husband and wife crow where very much scared over the wicked cobra, because whenever the wife crow hatches its eggs, the wicked cobra tends to eat up all the newborns. This situation left the crow family in fear. 

The crows got fed up with the activities of the cobra. So they went to a jackal to seek advice. The crows explained their situation regarding the cobra’s evil behavior. The crows stated that the cobra is undefeatable and all their efforts have ended up in vain. The jackal advise the crows that, "Any powerful enemy can be defeated through wit". 

The crows asked the jackal for an idea to defeat the cobra. The jackal said that, "Steal a valuable thing from a human being and fly away. Make sure that the servants follow you. Drop the valuables in the hollow space where the cobra resides. The rest will be taken by the servants".

The crows decided to follow jackal’s instruction and did what he said. The wife crow stole a diamond stud of a rich woman near the sea where she has kept it when she went swimming. The servants started following the crow. They threw stones at the crow. The crow successfully dropped the stud in the cobra’s nest. 

In order to retrieve the diamond stud, the servants killed the snake inside the hollow space. Then they found the stud and returned it back to the woman. Thereafter, the crows and their new born babies lived happily ever after.

Moral of the story: Even the most powerful can be defeated through intelligence
