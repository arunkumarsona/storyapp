How a sparrow came to grief

There was once a jungle where a few sparrows lived. The sparrows had a built a cozy nest for themselves on the branch of a tree. It was a very good source of shelter for them at all times. 
On one winter day, it started raining outside. The sparrows, however were protected by their nest. Just then, a monkey, who was being drenched in the rain, came running and stood under the same tree for shelter. One of the sparrows saw that the monkey was shivering with cold and was all drenched in the rain. She looked down at the monkey and said, "Why don't you build a house for yourself, monkey? You are gifted with hands and legs and are capable of utilizing them". The monkey did not want any advice at that moment. He in turn shouted back at the sparrow and asked her to keep quiet. 
In spite of this, the sparrow continued her advice. She told him about her nest and why it was necessary to find our own shelter and protection. The monkey was now very furious. He could not listen to her preaching anymore. The sparrow however continued to talk. The monkey angrily climbed up the tree and destroyed her nest completely. 

Moral: Do not give advice to those who do not deserve it.
