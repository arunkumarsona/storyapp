Elephants and hares

There was once a jungle where a herd of elephants lived. A lake very near to their residence had fresh water that the elephants consumed everyday. A days passed by, the lake started to dry up. To find an alternative to this, one of the elephants approached the king of the the elephants and said, "Dear king, the lake which has provided us water all these years is now drying up. We shall need to look for water immediately, else we all shall die". The king thought about it for a while. He then said, "I know another lake and I shall direct you all to there". 
They traveled for a few days and finally reached the lake. There was indeed abundant water there! At once, all the elephants rushed to the lake and started drinking water. However, they failed to notice that the ground was filled with many holes where hares resided. The elephants had harmed many hares by their trampling. After they were gone, one of the hares told the others, "These elephants are causing serious threats to us. Many of us have been injured by them. Though we are small in size, we must go against them". All of them agreed to this. 
The next day, the hare went up to the path where the elephants were expected to arrive. As soon as they did, the hare said, "Do not continue your journey here! We hares belong to the moon God and he has been very angry that you trampled many of the hares to drink water in our lake". One of the elephants replied, "Is it so? Then we wish to see your moon God and ask for an apology. The wise hare led them to the lake and showed him the reflection of the moon on the water and said, "This is our moon God. Beware, else he shall curse you with anger. The foolish elephants believed the hare and apologised to the reflection of the moon and walked away, never to return.
