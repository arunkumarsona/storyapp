The price of indiscretion

There once lived a cart maker who had a very poor business. No one bought his carts and he suffered huge loss. To earn better profits, he decided to move to another town. On his way, he found a camel which was in pain. She was about to deliver a baby camel. The man helped the camel and brought it to shelter. She finally delivered a baby camel. He then found a house to live in and took the camels along. He started to sell the milk of the camel and soon earned good money as well. With that profit, he bought more camels and started to make more money. However, his favourite was the baby camel. He had tied a bell around its neck as a token of love. All the camels lived together. Every evening, they would go to graze on the fields. However, the baby camel always wandered away. The others adviced him to stay in the group but the camel did not listen. 
One day, a lion came by and saw the camels. While all the other camels safely walked back home, the baby camel wandered away. With the help of his bell, the lion chased him and killed him.

Moral: Being foolish and not listening to advices can bring trouble
