The monkey and the crocodile

There once lived a monkey on a Jamoon tree. He ate the delicious fruits of the tree everyday. One day, a crocodile came and sat under the tree to take rest. The monkey, on noticing this, talked to the crocodile, to make him his friend. 
"Dear crocodile. Welcome to my tree. This tree bears delicious fruits and I would like to offer you some", he said and gave a few fruits to the crocodile. He ate it and was very happy. Everyday, the crocodile started to visit the monkey and they became good friends. One day, the crocodile asked the monkey if he could take a few fruits home for his wife as well. The monkey happily agreed and gave it to him. At home, the crocodile's wife said, "These fruits are delicious! I want you to bring me the heart of that monkey. I am sure he will taste a lot more better than these fruits". The crocodile was shocked to hear this and refused to deceive his friend but his wife did not listen. With no other choice, he went to the monkey and told him that his wife ahd invited him for dinner. The monkey agreed to come. 
As the crocodile took him on his back and swam throught the waters, he finally said, "Dear monkey, I am not taking you to have dinner. The truth is that my wife wants to eat your heart as she feels it will be tastier than the fruits". To this, the clever monkey replied, "You should have told me earlier! I have kept my heart in the hole of the tree itself". The foolish crocodile believed him and took him back to the tree. Immediately the monkey ran back to his house and escaped!
