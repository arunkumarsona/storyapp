the donkey and the washerman

There was once a washerman who had a donkey. The donkey helped him everyday in his chores but the washerman had no food to give to the donkey. As a result, the donkey started growing older day by day. One day, when the washerman went in search of food for the donkey, he found a dead tiger on the way. He immediately thought of a plan. He took away the skin of the tiger and brought it home. He put it around the donkey and said that he can now freely graze on other's fields as everyone will assume him to be a tiger and shall not harm him. The donkey did so and started eating as much as he wanted from other's field. One day, he heard a female donkey from a distance. He too started braying in return to meet the doneky. The villagers were surprised and finally got to know the truth. They beat the donkey up till it died.
