Elephant and king of mice

There was once a village which was destroyed by a disastrous earthquake. A few years later, a group of mice started to occupy the ruins of the village. 
Near the village was a lake. A herd of elephants visited the lake everyday and their usual route was through the village. Since the mice were really small in sixe, they often got trampled by the elephants. 
One day, the king of the mice decided to resolve the issue. The next day, when the elephants entered the village, the king of mice approached them.
"Dear elephants, I would like request you all to change your route to the lake as many of our mice are being trampled everyday. If you do so, we will always remember your favour and shall help you when you are in need", the king of mice said. To this, one of the elephants replied, "We shall not need the help of small creatures like you but we shall still help you by changing our route". Since that day on, the elephants took another way to the lake.
One day, as they were heading towards the lake, the elephants got stuck in a trap set by the elephant hunters. They tried their best to set themselves free but could not do so. Suddenly, one of the elephants who wasn't trapped, remembered that the mice had promised to help them. It immediately went to the king of mice and requested for their help. 
"It is time to help our friends. Get ready", the king said and brought along all the mice. The mice cut open the net with their sharp teeth, hence setting the elephants free.

Moral: Never judge anyone by their size.
