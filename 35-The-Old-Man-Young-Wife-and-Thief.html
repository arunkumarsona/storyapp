The old man, his young wife and the thief

There was once a old man whose wife had died a few years ago. He had always remained depressed after that wanted to remarry. In the same town, lived a young lady. Since they were very poor, her father decided to get her married to the old man, for a huge amount of money. The lady however, was very unhappy with the marriage as her husband was old. 
After the marriage too, she rarely talked to him. He did everything he could for her but she just wouldn't fall in love with him. One night, a thief entered their house. The young wife heard a noise and immediately woke up. She saw the theif in the dark and was frightened. She immediately hugged her husband tightly in fear. The old man was surprised by her action. He woke up to see the thief in their house. 
"Oh, thief! I would like to thank you a lot for entering our house. I have tried all ways to impress my wife but she never came close to me. It is because of you that my wife has hugged me today. You may take whatever you wish to from our house!" said the old man.
