The cave that talked

There was a lion who lived in a jungle. One day, he went out for hunting but could not find a single animal. He searched for hours together but was in vain. Since it was turning dark, he decided to return back home. On its way, it found a huge cave. The lion thought, "It is such a big cave. I am sure that some animal will definitey reside in it". It went inside the cave but saw that it was empty. It assumed that the animal must have gone out for hunting and decided to wait until it returns. 
A while later, a jackal arrived. The cave belonged to it. As soon as it was about to enter the cave, it noticed the foot prints of the lion. When it also notice that there were no footprints of the lion leaving the cave, it had a hunch that the lion was still waiting for it inside. The jackal thought for a while and then made a plan. 
"Oh cave! I have arrived. Why is it that you do not say anything? Every time the cave is safe for me to enter, you tell me to come in. If it is not, then you do not speak. If you do not say anything, I shall walk away". The lion listened to this and thought that the cave talks to the jackal everyday. To prevent the jackal from walking away, the lion said, "Oh, jackal! Please do come inside. It is totally safe for you to do so". Upon hearing this, the jackal immediately got to know that the lion was still inside and ran away from there
