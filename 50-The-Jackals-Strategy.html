The jackel's strategy

There once lived a jackel who went hunting everyday. One day, he found a dead elephant on the way. He immediately pounced on it to eat it but could not tear the thick skin. He then spotted a lion and said, "Oh lion, I have found this dead elephant and I offer you to eat him". But the lion refused to eat as he only ate the prey which he killed. The jackal then spotted a leopard and said, "Oh leopard, this elephant belongs to the lion and he has asked me to gaurd it and inform him about anyone who comes near it". As soon as the leopard heard this, it became frightened and left the place. The jackal still hadn't found anyone to solve the problem. Finally, he spotted a tiger and said, "I shall allow you to eat this elephant all by yourself till the lion arrives. You need a lot of food. You have become very feeble". The tiger fell for it and tore the skin apart. As soon as he was about to start, the jackal shouted, "The lion has arrived!" The tiger got scared and ran away. Finally, the problem of the jackal was solved!

Moral: Be wise to get what you want.
