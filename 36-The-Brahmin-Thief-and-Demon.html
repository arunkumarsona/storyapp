The brahmin, thief and demon

There once lived a demon named Drona. He was a very religious person and did not live a lavish life like the others. He wore moderate clothes, ate only as much as required and lived a very ordinary life. One day, someone gifted him calves. He happyily accepted them and took good care of them. They grew up to be very healthy unlike the brahmin. 
One day, a thief spotted the calves and looked at them. "The calves look very healthy. If I steal them, they will bring me huge profit", the thief thought. Hence, he made a plan. During the night, he brought a rope along with him and decided to sneak into the brahmin's house. On the way, a devil came by and stopped him. The thief, frightened, asked him who he was. To this, the devil replied, "I am a devil and I demand to know where you are going. Do not lie to me or else you shall die". The thied replied that he was going to the brahmin's house to steal the calves from him. The devil too liked his idea and decided to join him in it. Both of them went to his house and saw that he was going to bed. They waited for him to fall asleep. When he did so, the devil decided to kill him and then take away the calves.
Suddenly, the thief said, "If the brahmin wakes up while you go to kill him, we will get in trouble. So, I will tie up the calves first and then you can kill him immeaditely and we can easily take the calves with us". The devil did not agree to this and said, "No, the calves will make noise when you tie them and that will awake the brahmin". Both of them started to argue on this and by that noise, the brahmin woke up. He saw the devil and started chanting prayers. The devil ran away by that and the thief too was chased away.

Moral: The theives never succeed in their plans.
