The Foolish Sage

Once upon a time, there was a sage in the town. People from the outskirts of the town used to visit him in the temple to receive his blessings. To receive his blessings, the people would gift him money, food and garments. He used to sell all these and saved a lot of money which he kept under his arm wrapped under a cloth.
He never trusted anyone. One day, a swindler noticed the sage’s activities and wondered that the cloth contained of a treasure as the sage was keeping it so safe. He decided to steal the treasure. But he knew that he could steal it only if he could gain the confidence of the sage.

The following day, the swindler fell on the feet of the sage to join as his disciple. He impressed the sage through his sweet words. The sage told him that there would be a condition to be followed if he had to take him up as his disciple. The condition was that the swindler must stay outside the temple at nights so as to enable the sage to meditate at nights.

Then the swindler served the sage very well and tried to earn his trust but was in vain. The sage never trusted anyone so the swindler got irritated. He was serving the sage by massaging his hands and legs. He also helped the sage with the rituals and also cleaned the entire temple. The swindler got fed up and decided to kill the sage and steal the bag. 

Meanwhile, the son of the sage’s follower came up to him to invite him to perform a ritual in his house. The sage agreed to visit them and perform the ritual. 

On their way to perform the ritual, the sage went to relax himself near a riven. So he gave the cloth wrapped along with the money to the swindler and told him to keep it safely. The swindler has waited for this moment for so long. As soon as he received the treasure, he ran away with it by abandoning the sage.

When the sage came back, he was shocked to see his money missing. Then he realized that he has been offended by the swindler’s sweet words. He went back to his temple empty-handed.

Moral of the story: Never be offended by sweet words.
