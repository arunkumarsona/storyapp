Of crows and owls

Once upon a time, in a jungle, there was a meeting held by all the birds. All of them had gathered and got read for an important discussion. However, none of the crows had arrived. They started the meeting anyway. One of the birds addressed the gathering and said, "Dear all, I feel that our king, the eagle is of no use. He hardly stays with us and is always flying high above for his own reasons. We do not need a king who does not stay with his members". All of the birds agreed to the same. Hence, they agreed to elect another bird as their king. As they looked around, they felt that the owl would form a good king. A speaciality was that he could see during the night when there was most danger. He was also very wise. One of the birds then announced, "According to everyone, the owl shall be our king. We shall soon hold a ceremony to felicitate him". 
The next, a few Brahmins were called to perform the rituals. The jungle was beautifully decorated and the ground was covered with tiger's skin. Dancers and singers were called to entertain the crowd and a beautiful throne was made just for the owl. Just as the ceremony was about to take place, a crow arrived and curiously asked a bird what the function was all about. "This ceremony is taking place to felicitate the owl as our new king. You see, the eagle is not fit to be our king as he does not stay among us and is often flying high above all alone. What is your opinion about this?" The crow answered, "I think that it is wrong to make the owl as your king. He can only see during the night but is blind during the rest of the day. Morever, he is not as good looking as the other birds who are filled with grace and enchanting beauty. Why would you want to make him as your king?" The bird thought about this. Soo, this spread to everyone present at the function. Agreeing to the thought, all of them started to leave. 
The owl and his wife started to wonder what had happened."Why are they all leaving? Why isn't the felicitation taking place?" the owl asked. Only the crow had stayed there. Assuming that the crow was behind all this, the owl angrily replied, "You wicked crow! I had done no bad to you and yet you stopped me from being the king. I shall curse you so that you shall only have a sour relation with the owls from now on!"
The crow soon realised its mistake. It could have as well kept quiet and not given its opinion. 

Moral: To do not give your advice when not neccessary.
