The unlucky weaver

There was once a weaver named, Somilaka. His job was to weave clothes for the kings and queens of the palace. However, he did not earn enough money from it. The others, in the village, who weaved normal clothes were richer than him. One day, he went up to his wife and said, "I am going to shift to an other town for work. I am not able to earn enough enough money by this town". Saying so, he left to another town and continued his business there. He ended up earning a lot of money. At the end of three years, he had managed to earn 300 gold coins. He happily left the town to retunr to his village. On his way, he heard the voices of destiny and action. 
Destiny said, "He does not need so much of money for a living. Why did you reward him so much?"
Action replied, "He must be rewarded for his hardwork". The weaver then looked into his bag. All the money was gone! He felt very disappointed and returned back to the town. Within a year, he managed to earn 500 gold coins. On his way back to his village, he heard the two voices again and they repeated the same thing. This time too, he checked his bag and it was empty. He was very dejected by this and felt that there was no use of going back either to the village or to the town.He decided to end his life. Immediately, he heard the voice of destiny say, "I shall grant you a wish for your good deeds. Tell me what you want". He replied, "I only want the coins I have earned, back". To this, destiny told him that he was not in need of so many coins and hence, it said, "I request you to go back to the town and stay at two merchants house and come back. You shall then decided how much money you want". He did so.
The first merchant was a rich one. However, he did not treat him well and served him bad food and shelter for the night. The next day, he went to another merchant's house. That merchant, however was not very rich. He treated him with great hospitality and took good care of him during his stay. The next day, when he returned back to the same spot, destiny asked him how much money he wanted then. "I am enlightened. I shall take only enough amount of money for my living", he replied. He did so and lived happily ever after with his wife.
