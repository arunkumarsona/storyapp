Three fishes in a pond

One day, when three fishes where swimming in their pond, they heard the fisherman speaking, "there are so many fishes in this pond. so they decided to fish here by tomorrow early morning". Then they left the place.

The first fish gathered all the other fishes in the pond and told about the fisherman’s conversation. It also suggested all the fishes to leave the pond to safeguard them. The second fish also agreed to it. But the third fish made fun of them saying that they were cowards to leave their own pond where their ancestors lived for so long.
Some fishes even agreed to the third fish’s opinion and decided to stay in the pond. But the first and second fish left the pond with their families and a few other fishes to protect themselves from the fishermen. 

The following day, the fishermen came for fishing as they have discussed. They were happy that they got many fishes. The third fish and the other fishes which listened to it got killed.

Moral of the story: Prevent yourself before the danger arrives.
