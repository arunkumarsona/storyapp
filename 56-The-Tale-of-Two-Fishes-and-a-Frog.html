Two fish and a frog

There once lived two fish and two frogs in a pond. All of them were very good friends. One day, a fisherman arrived at the pond and saw that the pond was full of fish. He said, "I will come here tomorrow for fishing", and left. The frogs and the fish heard this. The frog said, "I think it is better we leave this pond soon". To this the the fish replied, "We very well know how to escape as we swim very well". The frog, however told them that they were not very good at swimming and hence, they would leave the pond. 
The next day, the fisherman arrived and cast a net on the pond. The fish tried to escape but couldn't do so. Alas, they died in the trap. The frogs saw them and felt bad for their friend.
