Brahmin and the crooks

There once lived a Brahmin in a village, named Mitra Sharma who was a worshipper of FIre God. One day, when the rainy season had arrived, he decided to perform a ritual for the good. For this, he had to do perform a sacrifice. He started his journey to go to a nearby village, in search of a goat for the sacrifice. 
Upon reaching the village, he approached a devotee. The devotee listened to his request and offered him a goat. On his way back home, a few crooks saw him and the goat. 
"How good it would be if we could get the goat for ourselves! It will form a good meal", one of the crooks said. They discussed amongst themselves and made a plan. 
As the brahmin walked further, one of the crooks approached him.
"Oh, Brahmin! May I ask why you are carrying with you, a dog?" the crook asked. The brahmin was shocked and angry. "This is not a dog! It is goat. Can you not see?" the brahmin replied, angrily. 
"Please do forgive me. You can carry on", he said. The brahmin walked further and was soon approached by another crook. 
"Oh, brahmin! Why are you carrying dead calf with you? It is not good for you to do so!" the crook said. The brhamin was again angry and said, "Are you blind? This is not a dead calf. This is a goat". To this, the crook replied. "Please do forgive me. You may carry on with your journey". 
A while later, he was approached by the last crook. 
"Oh, brahmin! Why are you carrying a donkey with you?" he asked. The brahmin again replied, "This is not a donkey. This is a goat!". To this, the crook replied, "Please do forgive me. You may carry on with your journey".
The brahmin now became suspicious. He wondered, "If all three men have seen different creatures in this goat, this might be a wicked animal! It is not right for me to carry this goat along with me anymore". He immediately dropped the goat and ran away from there. Finally, all the three crooks ran to the goat and happily took it along with them for a meal.

Moral: If a lie is spoken many times, it is assumed to be the truth.
