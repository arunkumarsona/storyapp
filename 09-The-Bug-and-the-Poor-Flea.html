The Poor Flea and the Bug

There lived a white flea named Mandothari. She lived between the white silk sheets in the King’s bedroom. She drank the blood of the kind every night when he is fast asleep and lived happily. 

One day, a bug entered into the King’s bed sheet. The white flea was shocked to see it. She told to the bug to leave the King’s bed. The bug replied that, "White flea! I might be a nasty bug, but kindly allow me to feed on the King’s blood once because the King eats the best choice of words and his blood would be tasty". 

The white flea agreed to the bug’s request. But she had one condition for the bug. That condition was that the bug must feed on the king only when the king is fast asleep.

Usually the bug’s bite is terrible. If the King notices the pain, then this might even put the flea in trouble. The bug promised that it would not feed on the King until he is asleep. 

Later on, the King came to the bed to sleep. The bug could not control himself so he bit the King before he fell asleep. The King felt the pain so sharply; he called the guards to check the bed to get rid of the insects. The bug carefully safeguarded himself by hiding in the corner of the bed.

But the guards found the flea in between the white satin sheets and killed her. Due to the mistake of the bug, the white flea died.

Moral of the story: Do not trust the fake promises, because you might end up in trouble.
