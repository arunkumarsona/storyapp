the lion that sprang to life

There once lived four friends who were brahmins. Three of them were well educated with divine knowledge whereas the fourth one did not have knowledge but had common sense. One day, all four of them set out to another town to test their knowledge. 
On their way, they found a dead lion's bones. One of them said that it was the right time to test who was more intelligent than the other. They decided that the one who shall bring back the lion to life shall be the winner. Henc, three of them sat down ans started to peform rituals and chant prayers to bring back the lion to life. However, the fourth one said, "Oh dear friends, if you bring back the lion to life, it shall eat you all up". However the other friends asked him to keep quiet and blamed him for being jealous of their knowledge. He knew that his friends would to listen to him and hence, he climbed up a huge tree. The others continued with their prayers and fianlly brought the lion back to life. As soon as they did so, the lion pounced on them and ate them up! Only the fourth friend was saved by his commen sense.

Moral: Common sense is superior to knowledge.
