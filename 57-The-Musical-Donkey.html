The musical donkey

THere once lived a donkey who worked very hard for his master. However, he was not provided with enough food. One day, he met a jackal. Both of them decided to go to a nearby field and eat. They found fresh cucumbers there. Both of them were very happy and ate as much as they wanted. They started coming everyday and ate the fresh cucumbers. One day, the donkey decided to sing a song after their meal. The jackal immediately said, "Do not sing or else the owner of the field shall beat you up". However the donkey did not listen and started to sing. The jackal immediately ran away. When the owner of the field heard the donkey, he came running and beat the donkey up.

Moral: Listen to the advice given by others.
