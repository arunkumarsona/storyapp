The brahmin's dream

There once lived a brahmin who was very poor. He only ate the alms he collected everyday. Since he got very less food everyday, he collected all the food in a pot and saved it for the future and ate only as much as he required. One day, he was lucky enough to collect more alms than usual. He kept all of them in his pot and went to sleep with the pot near the bed. 
As he fell asleep, he saw a dream. In that, his village was destroyed with a flood. During that time, he sold all his food and earned money. With that money, he bought goats. After the goats gave birth, he sold all of them in exhange for cows. He then sold the cows milk and also started making products out of it such as cheese, butter, etc. He grew richer day by day and bought horses too. He dreamt that he became very famous in his village and he got married to a beautiful girl too. They then had a son together. One day, he did not like the behaviour of his son ans scolded him but the son did not listen. He complained to his wife but she too was busy with her work. He got angry and kicked his wife but in reality, he ended up kicking the pot of food. Alas, it broke and all the food was wasted.
