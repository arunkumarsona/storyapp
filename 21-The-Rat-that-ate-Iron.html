There once lived a merchant's son, named Jveernadhana. He was a businessman himself but had recently faced a lot of loss in his business. Wondering what to do, he suddenly remembered that he had acquired a huge amount of iron balance from his ancestors. He decided to travel to different countries with the help of that money, in order to improve his business.
He wnet to a nearby merchnet and exchanged the iron balance for money. He travelled widely acroos the entire country and was successful in his mission. He then retunred to his hometown. He went back to the same merchant and said, "I would like you to return my iron balance, please". To this, the merchent replied, "Oh! I am sorry. I would have returned it but there are many rats in here which at up all your iron". Jveernadhana calmly replied, "I really wanted the iron balance back but what are you to do either? Anyway, I wish to take a bath in the nearby lake. Would you please send your son along so that he can take care of my belongings?" The merchant agreed and sent his son along with him. 
He went to a nearby lake and took his bath. After he was done, he immedietely took the merchant's son to a cave, pushed him inside it and blocked the entrance. He returned back to the merchant. 
"What is this? Where is my son? Why hasn't he retunred yet?" he asked, panicked. 
"Oh, I am very sorry. A flamingo flew by and carried away your son along with it", he lied. 
"You are lying! A flamingo can never do that. I shall call the elders of the village to resolve this matter", the merchant agrily said and did so. The elders arrived and asked Jveernadhana about the merchant's son. He narrated the same story to them as well. 
"It is impossible! How can a flamingo carry away a boy?" they asked.
"If rats can eat iron, then why can't a flamingo carry a boy?" he replied. The elders were perplexed at his statement. He then narrated the entire incident. The elders then adivced the guilty merchant to return his iron balance to get his son back.
