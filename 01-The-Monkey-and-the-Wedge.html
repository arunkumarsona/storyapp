Story about the Monkey and the Wedge

Once upon a time, there was a merchant who was working to build a temple by employing some carpenters and masons. The workers usually work from the morning till the evening. But they take a break in between to have their mid-day meals. 

One day, when the workers were taking their mid- day break, a bunch of monkeys were passing through the site. While a carpenter was cutting a huge log, in order to ease the work, he placed a wedge in between the log to prevent it from closing. Then he also left with the other workers to take his break. 

The monkeys were trespassing and were playing with the instruments in the site. They made a disaster all around the area. A curious monkey went in between the logs where the wedge was kept, and it removed the wedge. Then the monkey got stuck between the logs of the tree and was heavily wounded.

Moral of the story: It is wrong to interfere in other's work. So if you interfere in other's work, you will end up in grief.
