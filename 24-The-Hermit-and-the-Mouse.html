In the city of Mahilaropyam, there was a temple of Lord Shiva. A sage who lived there took good care of the temple everyday. He spent his mornings in visiting the city for bringing some money and spent his evening back in the temple for dinner. He used to collect the extra food in a bowl in give it to the co-workers of the temple. 
In the same tmeple, lived a mouse. The mouse had a habit of stealing the food from the bowl everyday. When the sage got to know about this, he tried to shoo away the mouse but could not succeed in doing so. He tried many other ways like keeping the bowl out of reach of beating up the mouse with a stick but the mouse would just not stop stealing the food. 
One day, mendicant who had come to the town, came to give a visit to the temple and also talk to the sage there. Instead of adressing the medicate, the sage was in search of the mouse with a stick in his hand to shoo it away. The mendicate got angry by this and said, "You are mannerless! I am here to talk to you and you are busy with something else and are not ready to even respond to me. I am never coming back here!" The sage immediately apologized and said, "It is this mouse which is bothering and troubling me so much. The food in the bowl is kept for the co-workers of the temple here but I can do nothing to save the food and get rid of that mouse". 
The mendicant thought for a while. He then replied, "If the mouse has so much of energy to be faster thane everyone and is making it difficult to be caught, then he must have a lot of food accumulated in his hole. That is where he is getting his energy from". The sage too agreed to this. The next morning, the went in search of the mouse's hole. After finding it, they relealised that they were right. The mouse had accumulated a lot of food in there. They took away all the food from the hole and went away. 
A while later, the mouse realised that there was no food to eat. Tired and depressed, it came out of its hole to steal more food. As soon as the sage saw the mouse, he took his stick and beat it hard. The mouse tried to escape but lacked energy to do so and hence, it was badly wounded. 

Moral: If you want to destroy your enemy, look for their power and attack it.
