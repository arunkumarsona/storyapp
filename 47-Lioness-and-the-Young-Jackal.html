The lioness and the jackal

There once lived a couple of lion and lioness. They had recently given birth to two male cubs and were very happy. They both took good care of their cubs. The lion hunted for food to provide to the lioness and the two cubs. The lioness took care of the cubs while the lion was out till evening.
One fine day the lion did not get any food till sunset. Hence, he decided to return home. On his way he saw a baby jackal and decided to take it home. But the lion felt pity for the jackal as it was a baby. So he decided to carry it home as it was.
He retured home and told his wife, "I found this jackal but it is just a baby. We cannot kill it. We shall raise it as our own child". The wife too agreed. The cubs and the jackal grew up together. One da, a wild elephant attacked their cave. As soon as the cubs were going to fight with it, the jackal adviced them to stay away and return back home. After returning back, the cubs made fun of the jackal for being a coward. This made him angry. He went to the lioness and said, "Mother, I was only trying to save the cubs but now, they are making fun of me and calling me a coward. I shall definitely take revenge. Upon hearing this, the lioness said, "I want you to leave this family immediately! How dare you decide to take revenge on your family". The jackal soon realised that it did not belong there and left.

Moral: Stay where you belong.
