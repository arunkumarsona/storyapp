The wedding of the mouse

There once lived a sage who was a very religious person. He lived his life very strictly with utmost discipline. One day, when he was taking bath in the holy river of Ganga, a hawk flew above him with a mouse trapped in its claws. The hawk dropped the mouse by mistake and it fell into the palms of the sage. The sage, noticing that the hawk might catch hold of it again, deicded to hide it in the leaves of a banyan tree. As soon as the hawk flew away, he transformed the mouse into a little girl, using his holy powers. He then brought the little girl home and told his wife to accept her as their daughter. She did so and both of them took good care of her. She grew up to be a very knowledgable girl. One day, the sage and his wife decided to get her married. 
the sage went to the sun god and said, "Oh, sun god! I wish to get my daughter married to you. Will you accept her as your wife?" Even before the sun could say anything, the daughter said, "Father, the sun is too hot. I do not want him as my husband". The sage was shocked by her reply. To this, the sun replied, "Get her married to the clouds. He is more powerful than me as he can block me and my light". The went to the clouds and requested him to marry his daughter. This time, the daughter said, "Father, the cloud is too cold and wet. I do not wish to marry him". To this the cloud told the sage, "Get your daughter married to the wind as he is more powerful than. He can push me away with his strength". The sage then went to the wind and requested him to marry his daughter. The daughter said, "Father, the wind does not stay in one place at all, I do not want to get married to the wind". To this, the wind replied, "Sage, get her married to the mountains. He is more powerful than me as he stops me from blowing". The sage went to the mountain and requested him to get married to his daughter. This time, the daughter said,"Father,the mountain is too huge and rigid. I do not wish to get married to him". The mountain replied, "Get her married to the King of mice. No matter how big and strong I am, he still manages to make holes in me". To this, the daughter finally agreed. The sage then converted her back to a female mouse and got her married to the king of mice.
