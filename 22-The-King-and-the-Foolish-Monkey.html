The king and the foolish monkey

There was once a king in an empire. He had a monkey as his pet. Though it was not a clever one, it was given all the luxuries and was treated very well.
One day, the king was asleep while the monkey was in the room. All of a sudden, a fly came by and sat on the king's chest. In order to shoo it away, the monkey swayed at it. Each time he did so, the fly flew away but came back again. 
The monkey thought of a plan. He brought a sword and decided to use it against the fly. As soon as it sat back on the king's chest, the monkey lifted the sword and hit it hard. The fly flew away but the king was injured!

Moral: Do not have the foolish as your company, else you shall be harmed.
