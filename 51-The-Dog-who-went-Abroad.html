The dog who went abroad

There once lived a dog who was loved by all. The dog often played with other dogs and lived happily. Once, a flood hit the town and was destroyed. In search of food, the dog went abroad, to another country. He started eating the food there which was in plenty. 
One day, the local street dogs of the country noticed him. They knew that he did not belong there and attacked him at once. He was severly wounded at the end. The dog then thought, "My place is the best and I must return there at once. Even though there is not much food, my friends will never harm me" and thus, the dog returned back to its own country.

Moral: Stay where you belong to
