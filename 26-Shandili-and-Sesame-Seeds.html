Shandili and the sesame seeds

There once lived a brahmin and his wife, named Shandili. They were poor but very happy together. 
One day, the brahmin told his wife, "There is a festival tomorrow. I shall go to the city and try to collect as much alms as possible. Also, since it is an auspicious day, you must invite a brahmin home and serve him food". To this, the wife repied, "How can I serve someone else food when we are so poor, ourselves?" The brahmin convinced her that even though we have very less for oursleves, we must always share it with those who are in need. Finally, the wife agreed. 
She saw that there were a few sesame seeds left at home. She decided to cook something out of that. 
The next day, the brahmin left for the city to collect alms, while Shandili started her preparation. She first cleaned the seeds in warm water and then removed the husks of it. After this, she put it outside to let it dry. As she went back inside and continued with her household chores, a dog came by and dirtied the sesame seeds. As soon as she saw this, she came running outside and shooed away the dog with anger. She looked at the seeds which were dirtied.
"I do not have any more sesame seeds. Instead, I'll fool the neighbour by saying these are clean ones and ask her for unhusked ones", she thought. She did so and went to her neoighbours house and offered to exchange. The lady soon fell for the offer and accepted to exchange. Just as she was to do so, her son stopped her. 
"Why would anyone want to exchange clean and husked seeds for unhusked ones? There must be something wrong with them. Do not accept them", he said, warning her. The lady too agrred to him and refused to accept them. 

Moral: If someone is offering you something that is too good to be true, there must be something negative hidden behind it. Do not accept it.
