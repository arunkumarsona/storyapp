The war of crows and owls

There once lived a group of crows on a banyan tree. The owls had always been their enemy. Every night, the owls used to attack the crows and kill them. Since the crows could not see well during the night time, they were unable to do anything. The crows gradually began to decrease in number. 
One day, the king of crows held a meeting with his ministers. He told them, "Our enemy, the owls have begun to attack us every night and we aren't able to do anything about this. I need your suggestions for this". One of the ministers said, "Peace is the only way out for everything. We must first make peace with our enemies". The other minister said, "We must wage a war against them. That is the only solution to get rid of them". Another minister said, "Your majesty, it is suitable for us to move away to another place as our enemies are very cruel too". The fourth minister suggested, "If we never come out of our nests, no one shall be able to attack us. Hence, it is safe to stay inside". The last minister said, "It would do good if we could ask our friends about it and take their suggestions". Even after listening to all this, the king wasn't satisfied. He then asked an old minister, named Sthirajeevi for help. He replied, "The best way to get rid of our enemy is by forming a spy and defeating them. Here I will be the spy. Do according to what I say. You must fight with me to catch the attention of the owls. After that, I will fall to the ground wounded. When the owls notice this, they shall definitely come to see what the matter is all about. By then, all of you fly away to a mountain. I will take care of the rest. Do no return until I come to you all and inform you to do so". The king agreed to his plan. Accordingly, he started fighting with him and pushed him to the ground, leaving him badly wounded. The owls too, came forward to see what had happened. Immediately, Sthirajeevi convinced the owls that he was the enemy of the crows. During this time, the crows began to escape to the mountian, as per planned. 
The owls decided to help the wounded crow and invited him to the cave where they lived. The crow instead, refused to come and said that it shall build a nest outside the cave and reside there. The owls agreed. Day by day, the crow began to collect hay and dry sticks, pretending to be building a nest around the cave. One of the owls suggested to the others that there might be something suspicious but none of them listened to him. One day, the crow flew away to the mountain where the other crows were hiding. It said, "Everyhting is now ready. I want all the crows to hold a branch of fire and come along with me". They all flew back to the cave where the owls resided. They dropped the branches of fire on the hay that was spread around the cave, burning it as all the owls flew away in fear. Finally, the crows got rid of the owls.

Moral: Do not trust your enemies.
